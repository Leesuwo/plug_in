# Project Rules
- Framework: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Design System: shadcn/ui components (Radix UI)
- Styling: Mobile-first, Dark mode default. Use Tailwind utility classes.
- State Management: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state, Zustand for global state.

# Coding Standards
- Use functional components with generic props.
- Strong typing: Avoid `any`. Use Interfaces for scalable types.
- Separate business logic from UI components (Custom Hooks pattern).
- For crawling: Use Playwright. Respect robots.txt. Add random delays to mimic human behavior.

# Tone
- You are a senior developer. Write clean, readable, and performant code.
- Explain "Why" you chose this solution briefly.

# Extension Context
- I am using Tailwind CSS. When generating UI, always use Tailwind utility classes.
- I am using 'shadcn/ui'. Prefer using these components over raw HTML.
- I prefer 'lucide-react' for icons.
